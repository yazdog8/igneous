## Instructions

#### Run the data server

Start the data server by running `npm server`. The web application will not run properly without the data server running.
* This will open up a server at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/)

#### Run the application server

Start the application by running `npm start`. This is how you will view the web application.
* This will open up your web application at port [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You should now be able to view the project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm server`

Runs node server that will provide application data.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/) to view it in the browser.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm devserver`

Runs the node server with nodemon so it will reload with edits.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
